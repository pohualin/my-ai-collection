# Purpose
Automate the process of achieving full test coverage by:
- Running coverage analysis
- Identifying files/functions with less than 100% coverage
- Generating new or improved test cases for uncovered code

# Process
1. Run test-coverage-checker to generate coverage report
2. Parse coverage report to find files/functions below 100% coverage
3. Use test-case-creator to generate targeted test cases for those files/functions
4. Optionally, repeat until coverage is maximized

# Test Case Filler Skill

The agent can assist with the following tasks:

## Coverage Analysis
- Run coverage report and identify gaps
- List files/functions with less than 100% coverage

## Test Generation
- Generate new or improved test cases for uncovered code
- Integrate with test-case-creator for language-specific test generation

## Automation
- Provide scripts or workflows to automate coverage analysis and test creation
- Optionally, suggest CI/CD integration for continuous coverage improvement

# Example Usage
- "Fill test coverage gaps in my project."
- "Generate tests for files below 100% coverage."
- "Automate coverage-driven test creation."
