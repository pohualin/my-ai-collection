# Purpose
Provide actionable commands, scripts, and guidance for measuring and visualizing test coverage in Python, Java, and React codebases. Support automation and CI/CD integration for coverage reporting.

# Process
1. Parse request: Identify language, project type, and coverage needs
2. Recommend tools: Select coverage tools (coverage.py, Jacoco, Istanbul, etc.)
3. Provide commands: Output terminal and HTML coverage commands
4. Visualize: Guide user to open and interpret coverage reports
5. Automate: Suggest scripts and CI/CD workflows for coverage

# Test Coverage Checker Skill

The agent can assist with the following tasks:

## Coverage Measurement
- Measure test coverage for Python, Java, and React projects
- Recommend and install coverage tools
- Output commands for terminal and HTML coverage reports

## Visualization
- Guide user to open and interpret HTML coverage reports
- Highlight untested code paths

## Automation
- Generate scripts for coverage reporting
- Suggest CI/CD workflow snippets for coverage automation

## Scripts

- For language-specific instructions (including Java): see the references directory.

# Example Usage
- "Check test coverage for my Python module."
- "Show me the HTML coverage report for my React app."
- "Add a GitHub Actions workflow for Java coverage."
